IMPROVING CERVICAL CANCER RISK PREDICTION WITH BIOMARKER TRENDS AND MACHINE LEARNING
ABSTRACT
We present a novel computational framework that integrates dynamic biomarker modeling with machine learning to enhance cervical cancer risk prediction. Our approach combines mechanistic models (Human Papillomavirus dynamics, tumor growth) with advanced algorithms (gradient boosting, neural networks) to address clinical challenges such as sparse data and class imbalance. The system evaluates radiation effects, predicts survival outcomes and identifies key prognostic factors, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and interpretability. By merging biological insights with predictive analytics, our model enables risk stratification, offering clinicians a practical tool for dynamic, data-driven decision-making. This work advances precision oncology by improving tailored patient care strategies.
